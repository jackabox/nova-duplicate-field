# ![Laravel Nova Duplicate Model](https://github.com/jackabox/nova-duplicate-field/raw/master/title.png)

### No Longer Maintained

This plugin is no longer maintained. I've had no time to maintain this as I don't use Nova anymore. I'm looking for someone to take over this and handle it, let me know if you want to maintain it! See Issue #33.

### Information

![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jackabox/nova-duplicate-field?style=flat-square)
![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/jackabox/nova-duplicate-field?style=flat-square)
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jackabox/nova-duplicate-field?style=flat-square)

Allow users to duplicate a record through the Laravel Nova Admin Panel along with any relations that are required (currently works with HasMany).

### Installation

```
composer require jackabox/nova-duplicate-field
```

### Basic usage
Reference the duplicate field at the top of your Nova resource and then include the necessary code within the fields.

```php
use Jackabox\DuplicateField\DuplicateField

// ...

DuplicateField::make('Duplicate', $this->model(), static::uriKey()),
```

### Customization

#### Except attributes
Pass an array of attributes to not replicate.

```php
DuplicateField::make('Duplicate', $this->model(), static::uriKey())
    ->except(['status']),
```

#### Override attributes
Pass an array of attributes with values to override.

```php
DuplicateField::make('Duplicate', $this->model(), static::uriKey())
    ->override(['status' => 'pending']),
```

#### Relations
Pass an array of relations to replicate also.

```php
DuplicateField::make('Duplicate', $this->model(), static::uriKey())
    ->relations(['translations']),
```

#### Relations except attributes
Pass an array of attributes for each relation to not replicate.

```php
DuplicateField::make('Duplicate', $this->model(), static::uriKey())
    ->relations(['translations'])
    ->relationsExcept([
        'translations' => ['slug'],
    ]),
```

#### Relations except attributes
Pass an array of attributes for each relation to override.

```php
DuplicateField::make('Duplicate', $this->model(), static::uriKey())
    ->relations(['translations'])
    ->relationsOverride([
        'translations' => ['title' => 'New value'],
    ]),
```

### Note
Duplicate field only works on the index view at the moment (plans to expand this are coming) and already passes through `onlyOnIndex()` as an option.

### Hooking Into Replication

**Duplicate Field** uses a relatively standard replicate method which is available via the Eloquent model. To modify data as you are duplicating the field use an observer on the `replicating` method.

### Issues

If there are any issues or requests feel free to open a GitHub issue or a pull request.

### Todo

- [x] Duplicate relations alongside the main post.
    - [ ] Integrate reattaching of relations, rather than needing to duplicate (i.e. belongsToMany)
- [ ] Catch errors to the end user.
- [ ] Alert for the user (confirmation possibly).
- [ ] Documentation on how to hide/show when needed.
- [ ] Documentation on how to hook into replication.
- [ ] Add a button to the resource view.
- [ ] Clean up methods for `v1`
